## Project Details
**Contributors:** klee161, khu21, jcha17, dhan26 <br />
**Repository:** https://github.com/cs0320-s2023/netflix-wrapped <br />
**Total time:** 3 weeks <br />

## Design Choices
**Our project is divided up into 2 main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.**

### `frontend`
The `frontend` directory contains the **UI** and **sending API requests** to the backend. Within `frontend`, we have subdirectories `public` and `src`.
- `public` contains the HTML file to be loaded upon starting the application in the browser
- `src` contains our assets, React components, frontend tests, mock data, and utilities for accessing our servers and Netflix Wrapped information by sending requests to the backend. 

_Here are the most important pieces of our `frontend` and how they function/connect:_
- `assets`is a package that contains various data structures and interfaces required to help organize and display the Netflix Wrapped report
  - `data` is a subpackage that contains `ReportJSON.tsx`, which is an interface that outlines the expected data structure of the Netflix Wrapped report generated by and received from the backend. 
  - `graphics` is a subpackage that contains `personality.tsx`, which holds the data structure that contains a graphic and descriptor for the NVTI personality a user is given by our backend ML model. 
  - `mock` is a subpackage that contains mock CSV and JSON files used for testing. 
- `components`is a package that contains the components of our Netflix Wrapped application
  - `landing` is a subpackage that contains the components of our Netflix Wrapped landing page
    - `Parsing` is a component that allows us to parse an uploaded CSV file into a JSON that can be sent to our backend
    - `Uploader` is a component which provides the input areas and interactions necessary for a user to upload their CSV and generate a report
  - `report` is a subpackage that contains the components of a generated Netflix Wrapped report page
    - `BingeData` is a component displaying the date and content a user binged the most on on Netflix
    - `MediaCarousel` is a component displaying a carousel of poster images
    - `NVTIPersonality` is a component displaying the personality assigned to a user based on their viewing behaviors by our backend ML
    - `ReportIntro` is a component displaying the introduction to the Netflix Wrapped report
    - `ReportWelcome` is a component displaying a welcome to the user, including their name if they input it on the Landing page
    - `Wipe` is a component that provides the information and interactions necessary for a user to wipe their data from our application and its servers
    - `WrappedEpisodes` is a component displaying a user's most watched shows and episodes
    - `WrappedFavActors` is a component displaying the most featured actors a user has wathced
    - `WrappedGenres` is a component displaying the user's most watched genres 
    - `WrappedMinutes` is a component displaying an estimation of the time a user has spent on Netflix
    - `WrappedMoviesOverview` is a component displaying a user's most watched movies
    - `WrappedOverview` is a component displaying all of the content a user has watched on Netflix
- `pages` is a package that contains the pages navigable through our application
  - `Error` is a page component displayed anytime anything goes wrong or doesn't load in our application
  - `ReportError` is a page component displayed when a user tries to access their report before generating it or after they've already wiped it from our application and its servers
  - `Landing` is the page component first loaded when our application is run
  - `Report` is the page component a user can access once they've uploaded their NetflixViewingHistory.csv and generated a report
- `test` is a package with our frontend tests (more on this package below)
  - `components` is a subpackage with tests of the components in the `components` package, such as rendering and interactions
  - `pages` is a subpackage with tests of the components in the `pages` package, such as rendering and interactions 
- `index.tsx` is the component where our router is hosted and our pathways to the different parts of the application are rendered and defined.

## Bugs
### `frontend`

### `backend`

## How to Run
### Build & Run Program
1. Clone our repository at [https://github.com/cs0320-s2023/netflix-wrapped].
2. Open the repository in two separate code environments.
    * within **VSCode**, enter the `frontend` directory using the command `cd frontend`. 
    * within another window of **VSCode** or in **IntelliJ**, enter the `backend` directory using the command `cd backend`.
3. In VSCode, run npm install. Once all the necessary packages or installed, run `npm start` to load the Netflix Wrapped website in your default browser.
4.1. In IntelliJ,...
4.2 In VSCode, install the 'Maven for Java' and 'Extension Pack for Java' extensions. Once the extensions are installed, Click Run Java for the file 'Server.java'.
5. Install Anaconda for Python following the steps in the website. Then, run 'conda create -n [environment name]' to create a virtual environment for machine learning.
6. Activate the virtual environment by the command conda activate [environment name]. Install the following packages: tensorflow (conda install tensorflow), numpy (pip install numpy), pandas (pip install pandas), flask (pip install flask), and flask-restful (pip install flask-restful).
7. Enter the `backend-ml` directory using the command `cd backend-ml`. Then run command 'flask --app server run' to run the NVTI classifier embedded in the python flask server.

### Run Tests
To run tests on the backend, enter the backend directory using `cd backend`. Then run `mvn test` in the terminal. To run
tests individually, go to the test class you'd like to run and click the play button on the left side of the code window.

To run tests on the frontend, enter the frontend directory using `cd frontend`. Then run `npm test` in the terminal.
